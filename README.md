# Note

Noted is an app for taking notes. It is a good equivalent of a notepad that you can use anywhere: home, work, public transport and etc. Add, save, delete, and more - all this you can do in **Noted**.
 
Here you can save all of your thoughts, dreams, or even secrets. Don’t worry, your secrets will be safely stored in Noted. Just pressed on the lock button and an important note will be protected by **biometrics**.
 
Also, if you are bored with the classical white/black notes app, in Noted, you have the opportunity to choose the color that matches your mood today.

For this app I used:
- Realm
- UserDefaults (saving color)
- UISearchBar
- Face ID/Touch ID
- Сocoapods (Realm/ColorPalette)
```
